•	# Monte Carlo Estimation of π (Pi)

This repository contains Python implementations and a Jupyter notebook that estimate the mathematical constant **π (pi)** using **Monte Carlo simulation** and compare it with **analytical series methods** (Leibniz and Machin formulas).  
It also includes visualizations, error analysis, and convergence studies.

•	Project Overview

The notebook and script explore different numerical techniques for estimating π and their accuracy, efficiency, and convergence rates.
## Implemented Methods
 **Monte Carlo Simulation** : Random sampling within a unit square to estimate π probabilistically ,  O(1/√N) |
 **Leibniz Series**  : Alternating series for π/4 = Σ(-1)ⁿ / (2n+1) | , O(1/N) (very slow) 
**Machin Formula** : |π/4 = 4•arctan(1/5) − arctan(1/239) , Very fast
